1. How do you control for biases?
  Ans: Null hypothesis significance testing is one way to control for biases.
  We can check that our sample is representative of the population to avoid selection bias.
  We can use blinding where the subjects and/or researchers do not know which group subjects have been assigned to, to prevent their expectations from affecting the results.
  We can use a control group to compare with the treatment group and isolate the effect of the treatment.
  
2. What are confounding variables?
   Ans: Confounding variables are factors other than the independent variable that might affect the dependent variable in a study.
  These are extraneous variables that correlate (positively or negatively) with both the dependent variable and the independent
  variable, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between the variables of interest.
  
3. What is A/B testing?
 Ans: A/B testing is a randomized control experiment where two versions (A and B) are compared,
which are identical except for one variation that might affect a user's behavior. It's widely used to 
compare two versions of a web page, app feature, or product to determine which one performs better in
terms of metrics like clicks, purchases, or any other significant indicators.

4. When will you use Welch t-test?
   Ans: A Welch's t-test is used when you want to compare the means of 
two groups and the two samples have unequal variances and/or unequal sample sizes. 

5. A company claims that the average time its customer service representatives spend on the phone per call is 6 minutes.
 Ans: You believe that the average time is actually higher. You collect a random sample of 50 calls and find that the average
time spent on the phone per call in your sample is 6.5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1.2 minutes. Test whether there 
is sufficient evidence to support your claim at a significance level of 0.05.
 Ans: H0: mean is 6 mins, H alt: mean>6 mins
  n=50>30
  we use Z test 
z= (6.5 -6)/(1.2/root 50) = 2.946 approx
The critical Z-value from the standard normal distribution table for a one-tailed test with α = 0.05 is approximately 1.645.
  Since 2.946>1.645, we reject the null hypothesis.
  Based on our analysis, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean time spent on call is greater than 6 mins, at the 0.05 significance level.


6. A researcher wants to determine whether there is a difference in the mean scores of two groups of students on a math test. 
  Group A consists of 25 students who received traditional teaching methods, while Group B consists of 30 students who received 
  a new teaching method. The average score for Group A is 75, with a standard deviation of 8, and the average score for Group B is 78,
  with a standard deviation of 7. Test whether there is a significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups at a significance level of 0.05.
  Ans: We want to test whether there is a difference in the mean scores of two groups of students on a math test. So, we use t-test.
  We use unequal variance independent t-test here (Welch's T-test).
Null Hypothesis (H_0): There is no difference in the mean exam scores between Group A and Group B (μ_A = μ_B).
Alternative Hypothesis (H_1): There is a difference in the mean exam scores between Group A and Group B (μ_A ≠ μ_B).
t = (x̄_A - x̄_B) / √(s_A^2/n_A + s_B^2/n_B)
t=(75-78)/(8^2/25 + 7^2/30) = -0.715 approx
using the formula for degree of freedom and plugging in teh values, we find that the degree of freedom
for Welch's t-test for the given data is approximately 48.17.
The critical value for a t-distribution with approximately 48 degrees of freedom at a two-tailed α = 0.05 significance level is approximately 2.011
Since -0.715< plus minus 2.011, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean exam scores between Group A and Group B at the 0.05 significance level.
