#I'm sorry I didn't follow along the last part in class. I'm booking a review session. Im sorry if my answers aren't fully correct.
#I'll make use of the review session to ask my questions and understand the topic well, and re-try the problems.
#I've tried to answer the following to the best of my abilities. Thank you!

#question 1

num_cols = ['job_years','hours_per_week','telecommute_days_per_week']
num_cols

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X_test[num_cols])
X_test[num_cols] = scaler.transform(X_test[num_cols])


X_test

y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)


#question 2


mse = mean_squared_error(y_pred, y_test)/np.mean(y_test)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_pred, y_test) / np.mean(y_test)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
